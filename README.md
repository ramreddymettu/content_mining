## Description
<ul>
	<li>The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet has been and continues to be valuable in many veins of data science.</li>
	<li>In these projects, we will use different Python tools such as <strong> scrapy and tweepy </strong>to parse html code, and build tools to crawl websites automatically using scrapy, and build tools to recieve twitter streaming data automatically using tweepy.</li>
	<li>Although web scraping will be conducted using the versatile Python library scrapy, many of the techniques i'm using can be applied to other popular Python libraries as well, including <strong>BeautifulSoup and Selenium</strong>.</li>
	<li>Although i'm using Python library tweepy to listen streaming data, many of the techniques i'm using can be applied to other popular Python libraries as well, including PRAW.</li>
